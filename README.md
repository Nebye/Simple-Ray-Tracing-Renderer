## Project Description
A simple ray tracing renderer, pretty basic but mostly just used as a learning tool for myself.

I will be following this [guide](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) to help me implement methods I have only read about till now.  This is my first go at making any kind of renderer from scratch.

Done completely on the CPU as implementation is my goal from top to bottom; not necessarily deal with drivers, GPU communication, optimize for efficiency etc (at least not yet).

I'll try to document a few thoughts as I progress below.

## Project Journal

### Day 01
Wanted to get started even though I didn't have much time today. At the very least, this should propel me into getting a more sizable amount done tomorrow!
Haven't written any C or C++ in a long time but thankfully it didn't take too long for me to get back into it. 
Just made an initial output image in the form of a ppm file (converted into png below) and a progress indicator which will be necessary later when the renders start to take a while.\
\
*Reminder to change the progress indicator to a Progress bar for fun?*

### Day 02
Decided to focus on another project for today but didn't want to completely skip out on this for a whole day so I read up on some old notes/textbook sections pertaining to ray tracing such as newtons method for root finding and algorithms for the surface intersections of rays with primitives.\
Will definitely get a good few sections of actual implementation done tomorrow...hopefully...

### Day 03

## Run Instructions
1) I'll add this eventually...
