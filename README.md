# Simple-Ray-Tracing-Renderer
A simple ray tracing renderer, pretty basic but mostly just used as a learning tool for myself.

I will be following this [guide](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) to help me implement methods I have only  read about till now.  This is my first go at making any kind of renderer from scratch.

Done completely on the CPU as performance isn't my goal; not necesarily deal with drivers, GPU communication, etc.

I'll try to document a few thoughts as I progress below.

## Day 01
Wanted to get started even though I didn't have much time today. At the very least, this should propell me into getting a more sizable amount done tomorrow!
Haven't written any C or C++ in a long time but thankfully it didn't take too long for me to get back into it. 
Just made an initial output image in the form of a ppm file (converted into png below) and a progress indicator which will be necessary later when the renders start to take a while.\
\
*Reminder to change the progress indicator to a Progress bar for fun?*
