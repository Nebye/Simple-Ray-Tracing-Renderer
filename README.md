# Simple-Ray-Tracing-Renderer
A simple ray tracing renderer, pretty basic but mostly just used as a learning tool for myself.

I will be following this [guide](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) to help me implement the methods I have brielfly read about in various textbooks.  This is my first go at making any kind of renderer from scratch.

Done completely on the CPU as performance isn't my goal; not necesarily deal with drivers, GPU communication, etc.
